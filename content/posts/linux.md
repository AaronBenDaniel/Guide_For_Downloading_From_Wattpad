There are five ways to run a Wattpad downloader on Linux: wpdl-py-cross (precompiled), wpdl-py-cross (Python), Wattpad_Downloader, Google Colab, and Docker.

*All of these methods have been tested on *Linux Mint 22.1 only*. While they will most likely work on other distros, there's no guarantee.*

### wpdl-py-cross (precomiled):

Using the wpdl-py-cross (precompiled) method if by far the easiest way to download stories from Wattpad. Choose this option if you aren't sure what to pick.

This method involves running a precompiled version of [ZhiFenBL](https://github.com/ZhiFenBL)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/ZhiFenBL/wpdl-py-cross" "wpdl-py-cross" >}}.

1) Download the Linux `.zip` from  [Github](https://github.com/ZhiFenBL/bin-wpdl-py/releases/download/v0.0.1/linux-build-v0.0.1.zip).

2) Extract the `.zip` file.

3) Run the `wpdl_py_desktop` file.

### wpdl-py-cross (Python):

This method involves running [ZhiFenBL](https://github.com/ZhiFenBL)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/ZhiFenBL/wpdl-py-cross" "wpdl-py-cross" >}} using a python virtual environment.

*The following guide is written using* `apt`*. For non Debian-based distros, use your native package manager. Please note that package names may differ.*

1) Install Python and Git:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv git
```

2) Clone {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/ZhiFenBL/wpdl-py-cross" "wpdl-py-cross" >}}:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZhiFenBL/wpdl-py-cross
cd wpdl-py-cross
```

3) Create a Python virtual environment:

```
mkdir venv
python3 -m venv venv
```

4) Activate the virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

5) Install `uv`:

```
pip install uv
```

6) Run wpdl-py-cross:

```
uv run flet run
```

**Follow steps 4 and 6 to run `wpdl-py-cross` again**

### Wattad_Downloader:

This method involves running [AaronBenDaniel](https://github.com/AaronBenDaniel)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/AaronBenDaniel/Wattpad_Downloader" "Wattpad_Downloader" >}} using a python virtual environment.

*The following guide is written using* `apt`*. For non Debian-based distros, use your native package manager. Please note that package names may differ.*

1) Install Python and Git:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv python3-tk git
```

2) Clone {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/AaronBenDaniel/Wattpad_Downloader" "Wattpad_Downloader" >}}:

```
git clone https://github.com/AaronBenDaniel/Wattpad_Downloader
cd Wattpad_Downloader
```

3) Create a Python virtual environment:

```
mkdir venv
python3 -m venv venv
```

4) Activate the virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

5) Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6) Run Wattpad_Downloader:

```
python src/main.py
```

**Follow steps 4 and 6 to run `Wattpad_Downloader` again**

### Google Colab:

{{< youtube Byf209XnNKU >}}

*This guide has a video example.*

This method involves hosting an instance of [TheOnlyWayUp](https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader" "WattpadDownloader" >}} on a Google Colab virtual machine.

*Note: This method requires a Google Account. If your account is part of a managed organization (work, school, etc) you may not be able to use Google Colab.*

*Disabling third-party cookies can interfere with this method, make sure to enable them when you use this script.*

1) Open {{< linknewtab "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15BVtjtboLrzTrnZ-9lQIKQaiMPR49H9g" "colab.research.google.com/drive/15BVtjtboLrzTrnZ-9lQIKQaiMPR49H9g" >}}.

2) Click the triangle "run" button in the top left.

3) Scroll down to the bottom of the page and ***WAIT***. The server needs a few minutes to start up.

The WattpadDownloader interface should appear after a few minutes and can be used as normal.

**It may sometimes fail on its first run. If the interface has not appeared and the output tells you it should have, try stopping the program and starting it again.**

To stop the downloader, close the tab. To start it again, follow these steps again.

### Docker:

This method involves hosting an instance of [TheOnlyWayUp](https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader" "WattpadDownloader" >}} natively on your own machine.

1) Install `Docker Engine`

Docker provides their own {{< linknewtab "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" "installation guide" >}}, follow it.

2) Run `WattpadDownloader`:

```
sudo docker run --rm -p 5042:80 sowansow/wattpaddownloader:latest
```

**You will need to run this command again every time you want to run the downloader. If you want to have the downloader permanently run in the background, run this command instead. You will not see the output mentioned below.**

```
sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 5042:80 sowansow/wattpaddownloader:latest
```

This command will automatically download WattpadDownloader and run it.

Once you've completed these steps, if everything worked right you should see something like this:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:80 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started parent process [1]
INFO:     Started server process [100]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Started server process [93]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
...
```

If you see that, you can access your self-hosted instance of WattpadDownloader by going to [localhost:5042](http://localhost:5042/).
