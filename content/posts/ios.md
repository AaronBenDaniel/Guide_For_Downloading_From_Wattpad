There is only one way to download Wattpad stories from a device running iOS.

### Google Colab:

This method involves hosting an instance of [TheOnlyWayUp](https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp)'s {{< linknewtab "https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader" "WattpadDownloader" >}} on a Google Colab virtual machine.

*Note: This method requires a Google Account. If your account is part of a managed organization (work, school, etc) you may not be able to use Google Colab.*

*Disabling third-party cookies can interfere with this method, make sure to enable them when you use this script.*

1) Open {{< linknewtab "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15BVtjtboLrzTrnZ-9lQIKQaiMPR49H9g" "colab.research.google.com/drive/15BVtjtboLrzTrnZ-9lQIKQaiMPR49H9g" >}}.

2) Click the triangle "run" button in the top left.

3) Scroll down to the bottom of the page and ***WAIT***. The server needs a few minutes to start up.

The WattpadDownloader interface should appear after a few minutes and can be used as normal.

**It may sometimes fail on its first run. If the interface has not appeared and the output tells you it should have, try stopping the program and starting it again.**
