What options a user has to download stories from Wattpad varies greatly depending on what devices they have access to. Certain programs will only work on certain devices, and many platforms have multiple available options.

There have been quite a few websites that allow users to download stories from Wattpad, but none have ever lasted. Wattpad will send formal trademark complaints to people who publicly host websites that allow people to download stories.

In general, it's best to find a way to download Wattpad stories that runs locally on a device you control. So long as you never make it public, you'll be able to use that program for as long as you want.

So far, no one has been banned or had their accounts closed due to downloading, but it's important to understand the risks that come with it. It is against Wattpad's Terms of Service and they are within their rights to take action against you. That being said, most likely worst that will happen is you get rate-limited if you download a lot in a short period of time.

If possible, the best method for downloading Wattpad stories is on Windows. If you have access to a Windows machine, that will be the easiest way.

Android, MacOS, and Linux are tied for ease-of-use. Use whichever platform is the most convenient for you. However, Android has fewer options.

Unfortunately, there is a written iOS guide for only the Google Colab method. There are most likely more methods, but I don't have an iPhone to test with and write guides.
